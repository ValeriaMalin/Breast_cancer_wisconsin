# Breast_cancer_wisconsin
Breast_cancer_wisconsin_classification_task

Objective: 
The aim of this project is to build a robust machine learning model to classify breast cancer diagnosis (Malignant or Benign) based on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset.

Dataset Overview:
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository and https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data .
Dataset contains 569 samples with 30 features representing various diagnostic measurements. Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
